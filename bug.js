This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific camera configurations.  The issue manifests as an unexpected behavior where the camera preview freezes or fails to render correctly after a certain period, or after certain actions are performed (such as switching between cameras, toggling flash, or changing resolutions).  The error messages might be unhelpful, or there might be no error at all, leading to a frustrating debugging experience.  The problem seems to be tied to resource management within Expo's camera implementation and might be more pronounced on low-end devices or when other intensive operations are running concurrently.

```javascript
// Example code snippet demonstrating the issue
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; // loading
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
        {/* Camera preview would freeze here after some time*/}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};
```
