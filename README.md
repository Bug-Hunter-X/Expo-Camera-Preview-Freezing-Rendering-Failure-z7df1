# Expo Camera Preview Freezing/Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview can freeze or fail to render correctly under certain conditions. The issue seems related to resource management within Expo's camera implementation and may be more prevalent on low-end devices or when other intensive processes are running simultaneously.

## Bug Description

The camera preview freezes or stops rendering properly after a period of time or after specific actions, such as switching cameras, toggling flash, or changing resolution.  Error messages may be absent or unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal example demonstrating the issue.  Try running the code on different devices and observe the behavior.  Experiment with changing camera settings (flash, type, resolution) to trigger the problem.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential workaround.  Further investigation and a more robust solution may be needed depending on the specific cause of the problem.
